Assignment: 


Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is known not only for its exceptional academic curriculum but also for its diverse range of magical creatures. Your assignment is to model these magical creatures in Java. Imagine creatures like Hippogriffs, Thestrals, and Nifflers roaming the grounds of Hogwarts.

### Exercise 1: Begin Your Magical Journey

Your adventure starts by creating a `MagicalCreature.java` file in the `src` folder. Define a class `MagicalCreature` within it.

Now, let's create our very first magical creature. Add the main method provided in Example 1 to your `MagicalCreature` class. Then create the variables listed below in the main method and assign the corresponding values:  

- String name: Buckbeak
- int magicPower: 8
- int agility: 7
- boolean isFriendly: true

### Exercise 2: Enchanting More Creatures

After creating your first creature, it's time to introduce more magical creatures to Hogwarts, increasing our total to three. Print the information for all three magical creatures.


### Exercise 3: Magical Fields

Instead of creating variables for each creature, use fields to define their properties. Afterward, create a new magical creature object in the main method to model this.

### Exercise 4: Spellbinding Getters and Setters

Implement encapsulation by adding accessors and mutators for each field. These methods will help manage the creature's state effectively.

### Exercise 5: The Summoning Constructor

Introduce a constructor for your `MagicalCreature` class, allowing you to set all attributes at once. This will streamline the process of creating new magical creatures.

### Exercise 6: A Gathering of Creatures

Utilize the constructor to add two additional magical creatures. Appreciate the efficiency of using a class to encapsulate creature attributes and behaviors.

### Exercise 7: Casted Information

Create a `printInfo()` method to neatly display all information about a magical creature. Invoke this method to ensure all is working as expected.

### Exercise 8: Duel of the Creatures

Now, for a bit of fun, let's have the creatures challenge each other! Implement an `engage` method where creatures can have a friendly duel, based on their magicPower and agility.

### Exercise 9: Mysteries of Variable Shadowing

Explore variable shadowing through examples. Understand the importance of the `this` keyword in avoiding common pitfalls associated with shadowing.

Checklist:
- At least three magical creatures created and correctly documented.
- Fields, getters/setters, and a constructor implemented for the `MagicalCreature` class.
- Demonstration of the use of classes, objects, and methods to manage creature information and interactions.
- An understanding of the concept of variable shadowing and its implications in Java programming.

Bugs and errors: If you encounter any discrepancies or errors, please open a New Issue with a detailed description of the problem.
